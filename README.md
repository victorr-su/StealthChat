## Why did I build this?
- Ever since I started dabbling in front-end web development, I've always wanted to try and start utilizing 
frameworks and libraries as I now realize how valuable they are. After picking up basic React skills, I saw
this project idea as an opportunity for me to learn more about React while building a cool app in the process.

## What are some features of the app?
- A login system where users can enter their credentials to enter the app 
- A plethora of functionalities such as an image uploader, a space for the user to preview the text they're writing, and a beautiful interface
- Ability to save chats and check the status of those who are online

## What technologies were used?
- Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, and Chat engine API
